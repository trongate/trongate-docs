<h1>Basic Example - Part 1<br></h1>
<p>The best way to understand how the File Asset Manager works is to go through a quick working example. Let's do that now.</p>
<p>For this example, we'll use the 'welcome' module that comes with all Trongate framework installations. Our goal, in this example, is to have a JavaScript file stored <em>within</em> a module. We're then going to display a very simple webpage that executes the module's interval JavaScript file.</p>
<h2>The Starting Point<br></h2>
<p>If you have a fresh installation of a Trongate web app then you should have a module named 'welcome' and this module should contain a controller file - namely, <strong>Welcome.php</strong>. The 'Welcome' controller file should contain a class with one method.<br><pre><code>
&lt;?php
class Welcome extends Trongate {

  function index() {
    $this-&gt;view("welcome");
  }

}
</code></pre></p>
<h2>Adding A New Method</h2>
<p>Let's add a new method onto our controller file. We'll call the method 'hello' and the method is going to load up a very simple view file that contains the message, 'hello world'. So, our controller code should now look like this:<br><pre><code>
&lt;?php
class Welcome extends Trongate {

  function index() {
    $this-&gt;view("welcome");
  }

  function hello() {
    $this-&gt;view("hello");
  }
}
</code></pre></p>
<h2>A Simple View File</h2>
<p>Now, let's create a very view file that contains some HTML. The example below shows a basic HTML template with the message 'hello world' contained within some h1 tags.</p>
<p><img src="../images/3/_file_as5vxa.png" alt="screenshot"><br><br>Save your view file using the filename, <strong>hello.php</strong>. Your view file should be stored <em>inside</em> the <em>views</em> directory, within your 'welcome' module.</p>
<h2>Displaying Content </h2>
<p>If you open your browser and navigate to your app homepage followed by welcome/hello, you should see your 'hello world' message appearing on the screen.</p>
