<h1>Introduction to Controllers</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Controllers are a fundamental component of the Trongate framework, acting as the operational core of each module within an application. They play a crucial role in managing the business logic that determines how applications respond to requests. By managing data, routing operations, or processing forms, controllers ensure operations are executed efficiently and accurately.</p>

<h2>The Role of Controllers</h2>
<p>In Trongate, controllers primarily handle server-side requests. They receive data from HTTP requests and process this data to make informed decisions about which views or templates to render. Controllers are also responsible for passing data into view files and templates - ensuring that each response is appropriately tailored to the userâ€™s actions and the current state of the application. Through Trongate's Model class, controllers fetch or update necessary data, facilitating robust and streamlined data management. Additionally, controllers can interact with and utilize controllers from <i>other</i> modules, enhancing modularity and reuse across the application. This capability promotes a flexible architecture where functionalities can be extended or modified without altering the core components of each module.</p>

<h2>Key Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Processing Requests:</strong> Controllers interpret requests made to the server, whether they arrive directly through URLs or are facilitated by forms and other interfaces.</li>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Data Handling:</strong> Controllers manage interactions with the database through models, handling both data retrieval and updates.</li>
  <li class="mt-1"><strong>Rendering Views &amp; Templates:</strong> Based on the processed data and the business logic, controllers determine which view file or HTML template to present, effectively dictating the output of the application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Controllers do more than just receive and send data; they orchestrate the logical flow of the application, ensuring effective communication and functionality across all components.</p>

  <p>Every module within a Trongate application must contain a sub-directory named 'controllers'. These 'controllers' sub-directories must house at least one PHP file, which serves as the main controller for the module, which by convention is named after the module in which it resides and which <b>must</b> begin with a uppercase letter.</p>
</div>

<p>Controller files may be considered the command centers of Trongate modules.  They are pivotal in making crucial decisions and managing the module's interactions with other parts of the application.</p>
