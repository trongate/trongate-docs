<h1>Basic Example - Part 2</h1>
<h2>Create An Assets Folder</h2>
<p>Inside your 'welcome' module, you should have two folders - one named 'controllers' and another named 'views'. Let's create a <em>third</em> folder - inside the 'welcome' module. Give this folder the name, 'assets'.</p>
<p>Inside your 'assets' folder, create a folder (i.e., a subdirectory) called 'js'. We'll use this subdirectory for storing JavaScript files inside our module.</p>
<h2>Create A JavaScript File</h2>
<p>Now, we're going to create a JavaScript file. This particular JavaScript file is going to contain one line of code - a simple alert command. </p>
<p><pre><code>
alert("JavaScript ahoy!");
</code></pre></p>
<p>Save your file as 'ahoy.js' and have the file saved <em>inside</em> the 'js' folder that's inside 'assets'.</p>
<p><img src="../images/79/_left_siCTKy.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<h2>Calling The JavaScript File</h2>
<p>Now, we're going to load the JavaScript file from within our 'hello' view file. To do this, we'll use ordinary 'script' tags with the 'src' attribute set to:<br><br><strong>welcome_module/js/ahoy.js</strong> </p>
<p>So, the code for your view file should now look like this:</p>
<p><img src="../images/79/_view_wiXqzC.png" alt="updated hello.php view file"></p>
<h2>JavaScript Ahoy!</h2>
<p>Save your file and refresh the page on your browser. If a JavaScript alert box appears on your page then it confirms that the JavaScript file has been successfully loaded.</p>
<p><img src="../images/79/_javascr327M.png" alt="calling a JavaScript file that&#039;s inside a module"></p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    What you've achieved here is remarkable. You have just created a module that contains PHP files <em>and</em> a working JavaScript file. This has <em>huge</em> positive implications for productivity because it means that now you have the ability to build very advanced modules that are self-contained. You achieved this without using any third party libraries!</p>
    <p>Here, you included a JavaScript file inside your module. However, it could have been an image, a PDF, a CSS file or some other non-PHP resource.
