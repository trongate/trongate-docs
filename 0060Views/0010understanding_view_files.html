<h1>Understanding View Files</h1>
<p>View files in Trongate are designated for <em>presentation code</em>, primarily HTML. These files may also include other types of code, such as JavaScript and CSS. Typically, each module within a Trongate application contains a directory named 'views' to store these files.</p>

<p>The <strong>views</strong> directory, positioned at the same hierarchical level as the <strong>Controllers</strong> directory within a module, is optional and depends on the moduleâ€™s purpose. For example, a module designed for data processing tasks, such as handling API requests or performing background data synchronization, typically does not require a <strong>views</strong> directory since it operates without user interface elements.</p>

<h2>Functionality of View Files</h2>
<p>View files contain code that is designed to 'present' data to the end user of the application. Within the Trongate Frame these files are nominally PHP files but cre composed predominantly of HTML and  JavaScript and CSS where required.</p>

<p>These files are not intended to contain complex procedural logic.  This promotes the concept of 'Seperation of Concerns' a key paradigm of the MVC design pattern. What this means in practice is that you can design view files that could work with a multitude of controllers that actually perform different parts of the business logic of your application. For example you may have several controllers whose purpose is to perform certain tasks on data that the application works with.  Each of those controllers outputs an array of data that would then be displayed to the end user in a table. Given that all the view is required to do is take data that is sent to it and display it in a table it really is of no consequence from which controller the data comes from.</p>

<p>View files are loaded through controller methods using Trongate's built-in <code>view()</code> method. For example:</p>
<pre><code>$this-&gt;view('welcome');</code></pre>
<p>This command is typically placed within a method of a controller class. When executed, it instructs Trongate to render (in this instance) the <strong>welcome.php</strong> view file located in the module's <strong>views</strong> directory, thereby displaying the HTML and any associated presentation content.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Trongate leverages pure PHP for its views instead of adopting separate templating engines like Blade or Twig. This decision aligns with the original purpose of PHP, initially developed by Rasmus Lerdorf as a templating tool for dynamic content management. Today, while PHP has evolved into a comprehensive programming language, Trongate capitalizes on its templating capabilities to enhance performance and reduce the learning curve. This approach not only streamlines development by removing additional abstraction layers but also optimizes execution efficiency, maintaining a focus on robustness and developer productivity.</p>
