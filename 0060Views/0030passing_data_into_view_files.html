<h1>Passing Data Into View Files</h1>
<p>The most common technique for passing data into view files involves creation of an associative array.  This array can be initialized from within a controller file and passed into the <code>view()</code> method, as a second argument.  As a reminder, the first argument that is required for usage of the <code>view()</code> method should be a string, representing the name of the view file to be loaded.</p>

<p>The following code snippet initializes an associative array with user data and then passes this array to the `view` method to render the 'welcome' view:</p>
<pre><code>
$data = [
    "first_name" => "John",
    "last_name" => "Smith"
];
$this->view("welcome", $data);
</code></pre>
<p class="mt-2">Upon loading the view files, the data array is extracted automatically, allowing its elements to be accessed as variables within the view. It is also possible to pass various data types such as objects, arrays, and booleans into view files. Consider the following example, where an array of cities and a weekday are passed to a view:</p>
<pre class="mt-2"><code>
function information() {
    // Create an array of cities
    $cities = ["New York", "London", "Paris"];

    // Prepare data array with cities and today's information
    $data = [
        "cities" => $cities,
        "today" => "Monday"
    ];

    // Load the view with the data
    $this->view("information", $data);
}

</code></pre>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>View files can access the original data array passed from the controller, enabling developers to inspect available data properties using:</p>
    <pre><code>var_dump($data);</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <p>For a well-formatted display of data within view files, utilize the Trongate framework's <code>json()</code> method:</p>
    <pre><code>json($data);</code></pre>
</div>

<p class="mt-2">When data is passed into the <code>view()</code> method, as in the array <code>$data</code>, it is extracted immediately, allowing its properties to be used as standard variables. For example, enhancing the <a href="../views/basic_view_file_usage.html">previously described</a> <code>greeting()</code> method to pass a name into a view file could be achieved like so:</p>
<pre><code>
function greeting() {
  $data["name"] = "David Connelly";
  $this->view("greeting", $data);
}
</code></pre>
<p class="mt-3">To display the value assigned to the 'name' variable in a browser, one could implement PHP short tags to echo the variable directly in the view:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;Hello <mark>&lt;?= $name ?&gt;</mark>&lt;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's nice to see you!&lt;p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p class="mt-2">This produces the following output:</p>

<div class="text-center">
  <figure>
    <img src="../images/75/hello_daBye5.png" alt="xxxx" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Screenshot.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <p>Extreme caution should be used when rendering data accepted from potentially untrustworthy sources, such as user inputs in online discussion forums. In those scenarios, it is advisable to use the Trongate framework's <span class="feature-ref">out()</span> function. This function safely escapes and formats strings for various output contexts, thereby enhancing application security. By ensuring proper encoding for HTML, XML, JSON, JavaScript, or HTML attributes, the <code>out()</code> function helps prevent vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS). Proper usage of <code>out()</code> can significantly improve the security of applications when rendering user-generated content.</p>
