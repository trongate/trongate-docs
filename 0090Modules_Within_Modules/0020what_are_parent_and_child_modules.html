<h1>What Are Parent And Child Modules?<br></h1>
<div class="alert alert-warning">Previously, child modules required additional code in order to work. Specifically, they required a constructor and destructor. You may have even seen tutorials going over this. However, the additional code for child modules is no longer a requirement. Ordinary modules can work inside ordinary modules.</div>
</p>
<p>The Trongate framework gives developers the ability to have modules contained <em>within</em> modules. When a module contains one or more modules, the parent module is referred to as being a <strong> <em>parent module</em></strong>. In Trongate, child modules (i.e., modules that are contained within parent modules) are called <strong> <em>child modules</em></strong>.</p>
<p>There's no command line required and definitely no need for any Packagist, Composer or vendor/autoload!</p>
<p>Imagine being able to drop just <em>one</em> directory into your app and immediately having:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A complete invoicing system</li>
    <li>A complete online shop</li>
    <li>A complete discussion forum</li>
    <li>Or, any other advanced feature that you care to imagine!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trongate makes this possible.</strong></p>
<p>All you have to do - to take advantage of parent modules and child modules - is add a module inside an existing module and also be aware of a few rules that will assist you in calling your child modules.</p>
