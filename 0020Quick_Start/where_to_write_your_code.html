<h1>Where To Write Your Code</h1>
<p>Within the realm of software development there is almost nothing as contentious as the subject of where or, to be more accurate in what should you write code?</p>
<p><b>All Software</b> is essentially nothing more than a collection of text files.  No more, no less.  It can be written in nothing more sophisticated than a simple text editor. </p>
<p>Most people though will opt for something a little more proprietary and with that in mind theses are some of the options that are open to you. This is by no means an exhaustive list, simply editors that the author has tried. </p>

<h2>Free Offerings</h2>

<h3><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> </h3>
<p>Notepad++ is a completely free source code editor which supports a number of languages. It is only available for use on the Windows operating system which obviously excludes it as a possible editor fow Mac and Linux users.  It has some syntax highlighting, auto-completion and function completion but is probably best suited to uers who are already well versed in the language they will be writing within it.</p>

<h3><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> </h3>

<p>VSCode is probably the most sophisticated free code editor now available and moreover it can be run across Windows, Mac and Linux. It has has excellent support for versioning via Git and supports a vast selection of extensions that make writing code easier (including one for <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jc-sf.trongate" target="_blank">Trongate itself</a>).</p>



<h2>Chargeable Offerings</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> </h3>
<p>Sublime text is a very popular Text Editor available for Windows, Mac and Linux.  It is first and foremost a text editor, albeit a very capable one, that does support syntax highlighting but not out of the box. As with Notepad++ this is probably best suited for use by people who are already well versed in the language(s) they intend to write in it. A personal licence to use it will, at the time of writing, cost between $99.00 - $168.00 US dollars. </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" target="_blank">PhpStorm</a> </h3>
<p>PhpStorm is one of may fully fledged IDE's produced by Jetbrains.  For writing php code it is probably unbeatable, offering as it does full intellisense, and excellent refactoring.  It supports Git version control seamlessly. It's one unique feature over other IDE's is the built in support for numerous database engines meaning that there is no need to leave the IDE to interact with the Database you are using (allowing you to wave goodbye to phpMyAdmin! A personal licence for PhpStorm is currently $99.00 US dollars. For around three times that you can buy a licence to use all 10 of the Jetbrains IDE's along with some very sophisticated addons.</p>


<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you are a competent PHP, JavaScript and CSS developer then a tool like Sublime Text will probably suit you well.  If you are used to working in an IDE the VSCode is realistically a better bet but in order to use it effectively with those languages you will need to add extensions to it.  As you can do almost all of that for free then VSCode is a very good choice of authoring tool for those on a budget.</p>
<p>PhpStorm though offers the best value and is the one truly Integrated Development Environment that you will not have to leave.  If you happen to use their other IDE's then you will be able to sync your settings across them all making for a very personalised coding experience across a multitude of languages.</p>
