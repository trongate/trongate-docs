<h1>The 'Get Where' Method <br> </h1>
<p>The 'Get Where' method is for fetching a single record from a database table. It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>$id</strong> (required) - an integer, representing the 'id' value for the record that you would like to fetch.</li>
    <li><strong>$target_table</strong> (optional) - the name of the database table to be queried. By default, the Model will assume the target table to be equal to the value on the first URL segment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Gets Returned?</h2>
<p><strong>WHEN A MATCHING RECORD IS FOUND</strong></p>
<p>When matching record is found, a PHP object will be returned where each object property key represents a column from the target database table, and each object property value represents a value that is assigned to the object key.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN A MATCHING RECORD IS NOT FOUND</strong></p>
<p>If the query fails to find any matching records then the boolean value of false is returned.</p>
<h2>Example 1 <br> </h2>
<p>The syntax below shows the simplest Get Where example possible. In this example, we pass a record 'id' as an argument and the Model will query the table whose name matches the first segment from the URL.</p>
<p><pre><code>$result = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get_where(3);
</code></pre></p>
<p>The code above will produce the following SQL query:</p>
<p><strong>SELECT * FROM <em><strong>tablename</strong></em> where id = 3</strong></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">In a working example, 'tablename' would be replaced with the first segment from the URL.</div>
</p>
<p>Below is an example of a Members.php controller file that contains a test() method. Here we're invoking a basic 'Get Where' command and then immediately displaying the results using Trongate's json() method:</p>
<p><pre><code>&lt;?php
 class Members extends Trongate {
 
     function test() {
         $result = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get_where(3);
         json($result);
     }

</code></pre></p>
<p>Below shows an example of the kind of output that we can expect to see from the above method, when Debug Mode is switched on:</p>

<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Below is a more advanced example: </p>
<p><pre><code>$result = $this-&gt;model-&gt;get_where(88, "fish");
</code></pre></p>
<p>The code above would produce the following SQL query:</p>
<p><strong>SELECT * FROM fish where id = 88</strong></p>
