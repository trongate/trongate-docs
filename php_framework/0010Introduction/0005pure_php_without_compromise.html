<h1>Pure PHP, Without Compromise</h2>

<p>Trongate is a revolutionary PHP framework designed for developers who believe in the power of <strong>pure programming</strong>. We reject the bloat and complexity of traditional frameworks, embracing a philosophy that prioritizes stability, performance, and simplicity.</p>

<h2>What is Pure Programming?</h2>

<p>Pure programming means writing code that stays close to the core language, minimizing dependencies and avoiding unnecessary abstractions. With Trongate, you leverage the raw power of PHP without the overhead of third-party libraries or bloated frameworks. This approach delivers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stability:</strong> No breaking changes or dependency conflicts</li>
  <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Lightning-fast execution without autoloaders or heavy abstractions</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> A clean, intuitive codebase that's easy to learn and maintain</li>
</ul>

<h2>Constant Evolution, Eternal Stability</h2>

<p>Some might assume that a framework focused on pure programming is old-fashioned or stagnant. Nothing could be further from the truth. Trongate is a living, breathing project that evolves constantly. Our <a href="https://github.com/trongate/trongate-framework/">GitHub repository</a> showcases our commitment to continuous improvement while maintaining rock-solid stability.</p>

<p>We're proud to be <strong>v1 forever</strong>, ensuring your applications remain compatible and maintainable for years to come. No more forced upgrades or rewrite culture — just dependable software that stands the test of time.</p>

<h2>Trusted For Enterprise Development</h2>

<p>Our approach isn’t just for small projects — large enterprises trust pure programming for its stability and performance. Consider these massively stable technologies, relied upon by major corporations for their critical systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Go:</strong> Still on v1, powering financial institutions and Fortune 500 companies with unmatched stability and performance</li>
  <li><strong>Rust:</strong> Also still on v1, used by Mozilla, Microsoft, and Amazon for its rock-solid reliability in mission-critical applications</li>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> A cornerstone in data analysis and automation at banks, insurance companies, and global enterprises, with a stable core that has stood the test of time</li>
  <li><strong>Java:</strong> The backbone of enterprise software at Oracle, IBM, and major banks, known for its robust and stable platform</li>
  <li><strong>C#:</strong> Driving business applications at Microsoft, Stack Overflow, and Fortune 500 companies, with a strong emphasis on stability and performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Trongate brings this same level of dependability to the PHP ecosystem, empowering you to build robust applications that scale with your ambitions.</p>
