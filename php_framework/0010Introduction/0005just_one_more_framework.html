<h1>Welcome To The Revolution!</h1>
<h2>A Modern PHP Framework for Developers Who Love Pure PHP</h2>

<p>PHP is the dominant server-side language of the web, powering millions of websites and applications. With a thriving community and countless frameworks, you might wonder: <em>Do we really need another PHP framework?</em> For a growing number of developers, the answer is clear: <strong>Yes, we do.</strong></p>

<p>While PHP frameworks have brought innovation and convenience to web development, many fall short in key areas like performance, stability, and developer productivity. Furthermore, the broader web development community has increasingly encountered challenges stemming from a phenomenon known as rewrite culture.</p>

<h3>What Is Rewrite Culture?</h3>
<p>Rewrite culture refers to the frequent breaking, rewriting, and reversioning of frameworks and tools, often without clear benefits to the end user. This creates challenges for developers and clients alike, who may find their projects prematurely deemed "outdated" due to unnecessary versioning changes.  One thing is for sure:  No developer wants to tell a client, "Your site is now out of date because the framework it was built on just introduced breaking changes."</p>

<h3>A Better Way</h3>

<p>Trongate was built on the belief that there is a better way. By prioritising stability and continuous improvement without disruption, Trongate provides developers with a dependable foundation for building robust, future-proof applications. This commitment to stability is what sets Trongate apart.</p> 

<p>Put simply, if there’s any PHP framework that prioritises stability more than Trongate, we haven’t found it!</p> 

<p>In addition to prioritising stability, Trongate was also built with <b>no third-party dependencies</b>. To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with using third-party code; sometimes it’s positively <i>beneficial</i>. The key difference is that Trongate was built — from the ground up — with no third-party code at all.</p> <p>This means that the framework is able to offer unparalleled levels of stability and security.</p>

<p>Whilst Trongate's approach to web development is a radical departed</p>
