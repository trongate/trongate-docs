<h1>How To Get Involved</h1>

<h2>The Best Way To Help</h2>

<p>In the world of web development frameworks, success is often measured by GitHub stars.  It's not a perfect system but - for better or for worse - that's the industry norm. </p> 

<p>To help increase the momentum of Trongate and raise its profile please consider giving the Trongate PHP Framework repository a star on GitHub:</b></p>

<h2>Other Ways To Get Involved</h2>

<p>Trongate is an open-source framework that thrives on community collaboration. If you discover any discrepancies, technical errors, or areas for improvement, contributions are highly encouraged. Whether it's submitting an issue, suggesting a feature, or providing a bug fix, your involvement is invaluable. Pull requests are always welcome!</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">Contribute to the Framework</h3>

<p>The Trongate framework is hosted on GitHub, where all contributions are managed. If you're interested in contributing to the core framework, feel free to explore the repository and submit your changes:</p>

<!-- <h3 class="mt-3">Help Improve the Documentation</h3>

<p>The Trongate documentation is also open-source, and contributions are encouraged to help keep it accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date. If you spot errors, omissions, or areas where you think the documentation can be expanded, feel free to contribute:</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">Talk About Trongate</h3>

<p>Regardless of what kind of presence you may have on the web, it would <b><i>really help</i></b> if you could spread the word about Trongate by telling people about it.</p>

<p>You can do this by:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Writing articles/blog posts</li>
	<li>Posting video tutorials/reviews on places like YouTube</li>
	<li>Discussing Trongate on podcasts</li>
	<li>Telling your other developer friends and clients about Trongate</li>
	<li>Mentioning Trongate on websites like <a href="https://x.com/home">X.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above things help enormously.  So, if you enjoy using Trongate, we'd be really grateful if you could help to spread the word.  Every contribution is appreciated and there's no need to ask for permission!</p>

<h3 class="mt-3">Have You Left A GitHub Star?</h3>

<p>Apologies for labouring the point but it's really important for Trongate to acquire GitHub stars.  If Trongate doesn't get GitHub stars then it will be regarded as being a "dead framework".</p>
<p>So, if you have a few moments to spare, we'd be really grateful if you could give Trongate a star on GitHub.</p>
<p><b>Every time Trongate gets a star on GitHub, it's one more person saying "yes!" to stability, "yes!" to open source and "yes!" to pure PHP.</b></p>
<p>Please <i>do</i> give Trongate a star on GitHub - if you can.  It's all we ask.</p>
