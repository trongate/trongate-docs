<section><h1>The Form Validation Helper</h1><p>Trongate's validation helper uses server side validation to assist developers in validating submitted form values.</p><p>All form validation procedures these following three steps:</p><ul><li>Submitted form values are passed through some validation test.</li><li>The results from the validation tests are assigned a boolean value of <strong>true</strong> (if the submitted form <em>passes</em> validation tests) or <strong>false</strong> (if there was at least one form validation error).</li><li>The user is then presented with either a 'success' message or some validation errors, based on the results of the validation tests.</li></ul><div class="alert alert-warning">A complete walk-through of how form validation works is available in the 'Form Handling' chapter of these docs.</div></p><h2>How To Set Form Validation Rules</h2><p>Form validation rules can be set by calling upon the validation helper and then invoking Trongate's inbuilt 'set_rules' method. This should be used on a line-by-line basis, whereby each form field that requires validation is processed via a line of code which takes the form:</p><p>[code=php]$this-&gt;validation-&gt;set_rules("name", "label", "rule");
[/code]</p><h2>How To Pipe Multiple Rules Together</h2><p>Trongate lets you apply multiple validation rules to a submitted value by joining rules together by use of the pipe symbol. For example:</p><p>[code=php]$this-&gt;validation-&gt;set_rules("name", "label", "rule1|rule2|rule3");
[/code]</p><h2>Running Form Validation Tests</h2><p>The form validation tests that you have created can be applied by calling the validation helper's <strong>run()</strong> method. Calling run() will produce <em>true</em> if the values passed validation tests and <em>false</em> if there was at least one form validation error.</p><p>[code=php]$result = $this-&gt;validation-&gt;run();
[/code]</p><h2>Displaying Validation Errors</h2><p>If there are validation errors, they can be displayed by calling Trongate's in-built validation_errors() method from within a view file. For example:</p><p>[code=php]&lt;?= validation_errors() ?&gt;[/code]</p><h2>Formatting Validation Errors</h2><p>By default, each validation error is displayed as a paragraph with red text. However, you can modify the appearance of validation errors by adding opening and closing tags inside your validation_errors() declaration. For example:</p><p>[code=php]formatted-errors[/code]</p><h2>Validation Rules Reference</h2><p>form-validation-table</p></section>
