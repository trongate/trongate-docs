<h1>Image Manipulation</h1>
<p>The Trongate <a href="documentation-ref/list_refs/class_reference/the-image-class" target="_blank">Image class</a> provides a comprehensive suite of methods for efficient and secure image manipulation within your application. This class supports functionalities like loading, resizing, and saving images. It uses PHP's GD library and supports JPEG, GIF, PNG, and WEBP image formats. Access restrictions are in place to prevent unauthorized access to critical directories such as 'config', 'engine', and 'templates', as well as any files directly under the root application level (e.g., '.htaccess').</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the Trongate Image class, you need to instantiate the class and then call its methods. Hereâ€™s a basic example:</p>

[code=php]
$image = new Image();

try {
    $image_path = APPPATH . 'public/uploads/image.jpg';
    $image->load($image_path);
    $image->resize_to_width(300);
    $resized_image_path = APPPATH . 'public/uploads/resized_image.jpg';
    $image->save($resized_image_path);
    echo "Image resized successfully.";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}
[/code]

<p>This example demonstrates how to load an image from a specific directory, resize it, and save the resized image to another directory, all while using Trongate's APPPATH constant for path management.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>In the above example, the <code>APPPATH</code> constant is used to return the absolute file path of the application's root directory.  Additional information about this and other helpful features are available <a href="documentation/display/php_framework/helpers-explained/other-helpful-features">from here</a>.</p>
