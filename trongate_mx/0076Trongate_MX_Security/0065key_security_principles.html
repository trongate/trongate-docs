<h1>Key Security Principles</h1>

<p>The Trongate PHP framework incorporates a comprehensive suite of security features to ensure your applications are secure from the ground up. These features include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Form Helpers:</strong> PHP functions designed to simplify the creation of secure forms and address common security concerns.</li>
  <li><strong>Validation Class:</strong> A robust input validation system that helps prevent malicious data from compromising your application.</li>
  <li><strong>CSRF Protection:</strong> A built-in mechanism to defend against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>The Database 'Model' Class:</strong> A secure interface for database operations, leveraging Trongate's PDO library to mitigate SQL injection risks.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Trongate MX users, these security features are available out of the box and require no additional configuration, enabling developers to immediately work within a secure and cohesive ecosystem. By seamlessly integrating security with all aspects of modern web development - including the construction of secure API endpoints - Trongate empowers developers to achieve unparalleled efficiency and confidence in their projects.</p>

<h2>Securing API Endpoints</h2>

<p>API endpoints serve as crucial interaction points between your application and external systems or users. Securing these endpoints is essential to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.</p>

<h3>Strategies for Securing Endpoints</h3>

<p>There are a variety of strategies that developers can use to secure API endpoints. The strategies covered in <i>this</i> chapter include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authorization Headers:</strong> How to include authorization data (e.g., tokens or API keys) in HTTP request headers to verify the authenticity of requests.</li>
  <li><strong>CSRF Protection:</strong> How to protect web applications against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> How to use Trongate's security token system for authorization and authentication.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Developer Flexibility and Broader Security Considerations</h2>

<p>While Trongate MX provides powerful built-in security features, developers should consider the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Flexibility in Security Implementation:</strong> You're not restricted to using Trongate's built-in security tools. If needed, you can integrate custom or third-party security solutions to meet your specific requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Foundational Security Practices:</strong> Beyond using tools, developers should maintain a strong understanding of essential web security principles. These include hosting applications over SSL to encrypt data transmission, securing server configurations, and staying informed about emerging vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>

<p>By combining Trongate MX's security tools with these best practices, developers can build robust, secure applications capable of meeting the demands of modern web development.</p>
