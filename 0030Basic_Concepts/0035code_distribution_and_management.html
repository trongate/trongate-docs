<h1>Code Distribution & Management</h1>
<p>As with other leading PHP frameworks, Trongate developers can <a href="../controllers/using_packagist_with_trongate.html">use and share code using Packagist</a>.  However, the Trongate framework also offers "<a href="https://trongate.io/module-market" target="_blank">The Module Market</a>" - a dedicated platform tailored specifically for Trongate. Unlike Packagist, which serves a broad array of PHP frameworks, The Module Market focuses exclusively on Trongate modules, aiming for higher standards of integration and security. This platform streamlines module discovery and integration for Trongate developers, providing modules that must meet specific standards of quality and compatibility unique to Trongate, as enforced by the individual developers.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info">Currently all of the modules that are available from the Trongate Module Market are open source and can be downloaded and used for free.<br><br>The Module Market allows for the option to submit modules that would incur a charge for use and it is likely that in the future it may contain a mixture of both paid for and free offerings.</div>

<h2>How Trongate Encourages Code Stability &amp; Integrity</h2>

<p>Trongate's Module Market operates under a <strong>single point of accountability</strong> model, where a single developer is responsible for uploading and maintaining each module. This model contrasts with the approach of Packagist, where numerous contributors can modify a single package, potentially breaking code by deleting or altering third-party dependencies. The single point of accountability model encourages consistent quality and stability for each module, significantly reducing the risk of integration issues and vulnerabilities often associated with broader contributor bases. This developer-focused approach thus promotes security within the Trongate ecosystem, since each developer is directly accountable for their contributions.</p>
